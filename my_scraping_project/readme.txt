# AI-Driven Multi-Agent Scraping Project

Welcome to the **AI-Driven Multi-Agent Scraping Project**! This tool is designed to **automate data collection**, **clean and analyze** the results, and **provide actionable insights** via an easy-to-use local interface. The project uses **Python** and **Docker** (optional) for modular “agent” components, making it simple to scale and integrate new sites or analytics features.

---

## Goals

1. **Efficient Data Collection**  
   - Scrape eBay, Craigslist, Alibaba, and other marketplaces for product listings (e.g., iPhone parts).
   - Implement stealth measures (rotating user-agents, random delays) to reduce IP blocks.

2. **Automated Data Cleaning & Parsing**  
   - Normalize and merge raw data into consistent CSV/JSON files or a local database.
   - Use a dedicated agent to handle duplicates, missing fields, and format conversions.

3. **AI-Driven Insights & Forecasting**  
   - Employ machine learning (time-series forecasting, GPT-based suggestions) to analyze pricing trends and make recommendations.
   - Present data and summaries in a local dashboard (e.g., Streamlit or Flask UI).

4. **Extensibility & Modularity**  
   - Each “agent” (scraper, data cleaner, manager) operates independently, allowing easy maintenance and future growth.
   - Encourage experimentation with new features (e.g., advanced ML, auto-adapting scrapers) as you learn.

##Roadmap


Add More Scraper Agents: Craigslist, Alibaba, Amazon, etc.

Stealth Enhancements: Rotating proxies, anti-captcha strategies.

Database Integration: Move from CSV to SQLite or PostgreSQL for larger-scale data.

Advanced Analytics: Time-series models (Prophet, ARIMA) for price and demand forecasting.

AI Auto-Tuning: Let GPT or other ML models suggest new scrapers or parsing logic if site layouts change.
